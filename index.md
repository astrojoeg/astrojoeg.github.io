Hi! I'm a third-year astronomy and physics undergraduate at UT Austin. Here you can find some blog posts, personal info, science, slightly decent photographs, and maybe cooking recipes (one day). 

- I sometimes play trumpet too. You can find of thread of quarantine concerts on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astrojoeg/status/1241500030877544449?s=20).
What else do you need?

### my history

I was born in New Orleans, but quickly moved to Nacogdoches, TX, where I lived until I came to Austin. I like space. I now work on outbursting, pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs, which are cool, but I really want to try my hand at high-redshift galaxies, and basically every other field. Hopefully you'll see the fruits those endeavors reap in my repositories and in sci-comm.
