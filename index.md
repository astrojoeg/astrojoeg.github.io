Hi! I'm Joseph (he/him pronouns), a first-year Astronomy PhD student worker at Boston University. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in Astronomy and Physics in May 2021. I am currently working in the [BU White Dwarf Group](https://sites.bu.edu/buwd/) with Prof. JJ Hermes where I am most focused on hunting for and characterizing the oldest planetary systems in the galaxy. In particular, I am searching for the carcasses of rocky exoplanets and exoasteroids orbiting around their ancient host stars. If the geometry of these remnant planetary systems are fortuitously aligned, we can observe the cloud or disk of planetary debris transit the white dwarf, which informs us of how the remnant planetary system is structured and evolving. I also used these systems to test how similar (or different) the rocks in extra-solar planetary systems are compared to those in our Solar System. I also am interested in white dwarfs that vary in brightness due to other reasons, such as pulsating white dwarfs and strongly magnetic white dwarfs.
<!-- so I am currently appluing to astronomy PhD programs with anticipated start in fall 2021 so I can fulfull my childhood dream of becoming a professor of astornomy. In particular, I aspire to become what I call a twenty-first century astronomer: an astronomer who works to dismantle the oppressive and meritocratic structures of the Academy in order to make our discipline truly accessible, equitable, and supportive of Black and Indigenous astronomers especially. I also seek to abolish the imperialist tradition of Western Astronomy, astrocolonialism, in the name of Indigenous liberation. In terms of astronomical reserach, my current interests lie in discovering and characterizing white dwarf stars, particularly pulsating ZZ Cetis and white dwarfs that harbor dusty, metal-rich debris. In fact, in our paper [Guidry et al. (submitted, arXiv:2012.00035)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00035), we potentially more than tripled the known number of these systems from 2 to 5! In graduate school, I intend to pursue these interests by combing through big data transient sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility and follow-up interesting objects at the telescope with photometry and spectroscopy (I love observing!!!). -->

Welcome to my website. Beyond my research you can find here professional documentation like my CV and other resources. I have many project ideas for this space that are works in progress, so whenever I get to it you will be able to find some blog posts and essays, slightly decent photographs, and maybe cooking recipes here. 

- I sometimes play trumpet too. You can find of thread of quarantine concerts on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astrojoeg/status/1241500030877544449?s=20).

<!-- ### My story

I was born in New Orleans, but quickly moved to Nacogdoches, TX, where I lived until I came to Austin, and then back to Nac cause COVID :/ I like astronomy. I have spent the entirety of my undergraduate career studying variable white dwarfs, but in general I'm really interested in all time domain astrophysics. High z stuff seems pretty cool too. Whatever I end up working in graduate schoole (*fingers crossed*), hopefully you'll see the fruits those endeavors reap in my repositories and in sci-comm in the near future. I have plans, I promise. -->
