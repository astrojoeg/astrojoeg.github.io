Hi! I'm a third-year astronomy and physics undergraduate at UT Austin. Whenever I get to it, here you will be able to find some blog posts, personal info, my science!!, slightly decent photographs, and maybe cooking recipes. 

- I sometimes play trumpet too. You can find of thread of quarantine concerts on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astrojoeg/status/1241500030877544449?s=20).

### My story

I was born in New Orleans, but quickly moved to Nacogdoches, TX, where I lived until I came to Austin. I like space. I now work on outbursting, pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs, which are cool, but I really want to try my hand at high-redshift galaxies, and basically every other field, and so I'll be exploring the high-z universe beginning fall 2020. Hopefully you'll see the fruits those endeavors reap in my repositories and in sci-comm in the near future. I have plans, I promise.
