Hi! I'm a fourth year astronomy and physics undergraduate at UT Austin. Whenever I get to it, here you will be able to find some blog posts, personal info, my science!!, slightly decent photographs, and maybe cooking recipes. 

- I sometimes play trumpet too. You can find of thread of quarantine concerts on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astrojoeg/status/1241500030877544449?s=20).

### My story

I was born in New Orleans, but quickly moved to Nacogdoches, TX, where I lived until I came to Austin, and then back to Nac cause COVID :/ I like astronomy. I have spent the entirety of my undergraduate career studying variable white dwarfs, but in general I'm really interested in all time domain astrophysics. High z stuff seems pretty cool too. Whatever I end up working in graduate schoole (*fingers crossed*), hopefully you'll see the fruits those endeavors reap in my repositories and in sci-comm in the near future. I have plans, I promise.
