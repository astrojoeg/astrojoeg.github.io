Hi! I'm Joseph (he/him), a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Boston University's Department of Astronomy. I work in the [BU White Dwarf Group](https://sites.bu.edu/buwd/) with Prof. JJ Hermes where I am especially focused on searching for and characterizing the oldest planetary systems in the galaxy. I am specialize in analyzing the carcasses of tidally disrupted rocky exoplanetary bodies as they transit white dwarfs. Over 40% of white dwarfs are accreting planetary material, but we have yet to completely observe how this debris is delivered to the stellar surface. Building a census of these transiting debris systems allows us to place constraints on the roadmaps to accretion. I also take interest in white dwarfs that vary in brightness due to other reasons, such as pulsating white dwarfs and strongly magnetic white dwarfs. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in Astronomy and Physics in May 2021. I anticipate defending my dissertation in 2026 and anticipate a career in K-12 education.

Welcome to my website. Beyond my research you can find here professional documentation like my CV (updated as of Deecember 2025).
